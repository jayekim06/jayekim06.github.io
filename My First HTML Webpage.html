    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <details>
      <summary>My Childhood</summary>
      <p>I was born and raised in Davao City. When I was young, I used to believe
      that power rangers are real. I admire their appearance and abilities in
      fighting the villains. </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Talents</summary>
      <p>Way back in my elementary days, I already have this urge to sing and dance
      in front of an audience. Now, even though I was not able to really forge and develop
      my talents, I still want to perform in a crowd and just enjoy art in general. </p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>Hobbies</summary>
      <p>In my vacant time, I like to eat, dance, sing, travel, or watch movies.
      I am not that much of a sporty person but I know how to play volleyball and badminton.
      Recently, I am more fond in creating TikTok videos since it serves as my aid in
      stress and pressure brought by my academic and personal life.</p>
